# AI Text-to-Image Generator

Welcome to the AI Text-to-Image Generator project! This library utilizes Hugging Face's Transformers and Diffusers to create stunning images from textual descriptions.

## Overview

Text-to-image generation is a fascinating area within AI. This project harnesses the power of Transformers and Diffusers, two cutting-edge models from Hugging Face, to convert text descriptions into high-quality images.

## Features

- State-of-the-art AI models: We use Hugging Face's Transformers and Diffusers, known for their exceptional performance in text and image generation tasks.

- Easy-to-use API: Generate images from text with just a few lines of Python code.

- High-quality results: Create detailed and realistic images that match your textual descriptions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use this AI text-to-image generator by following these steps:

1. Initialize the generator.
2. Provide a textual description.
3. Generate an image from the text.
4. Save or display the resulting image.

A simple Python code snippet to get you started:

```python
from text_to_image import TextToImageGenerator
